# Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Heart Disease

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset with various health metrics to develop a predictive model for heart disease. By employing exploratory data analysis (EDA), we uncovered valuable insights into patterns and relationships within the data. After preprocessing steps like handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, we built machine learning models to predict individuals' likelihood of heart disease. The project includes thorough EDA, preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and comprehensive documentation.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis for a deep understanding of the data.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
- **Model Implementation**: Classification algorithms such as KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Utilization of ensemble methods and regularization techniques for improved performance.
- **Documentation and Visualization**: Comprehensive documentation and visualization of results.

## Future Scope
To enhance the model and dataset:
- **Increase Test Data Size**: Collect more data to enhance the sample size.
- **Data Augmentation**: Use techniques like data synthesis to expand the dataset artificially.
- **Cross-Validation**: Employ k-fold cross-validation for better use of available data.
- **Bootstrap Resampling**: Generate multiple datasets through resampling for robust evaluation.
- **Qualitative Evaluation**: Review individual predictions and conduct expert evaluations.
- **Alternative Metrics**: Explore metrics like the area under the ROC curve.
- **Model Regularization**: Apply techniques like L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Utilize bagging or boosting to improve model performance.

These steps will help develop more accurate models for predicting heart disease, including using Gain/Lift chart visualizations to assess model performance and estimate the probability of heart disease based on available variables.
